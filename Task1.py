# Image classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is a common task in computer vision. Here, I'll provide you with a step-by-step guide using TensorFlow and Keras. I'll assume you have a basic understanding of Python and deep learning concepts.

#Step 1: Import Libraries python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models
from tensorflow.keras.datasets import cifar10
from tensorflow.keras.utils import to_categorical
#Step 2: Load and Preprocess the Data
# Load CIFAR-10 dataset
(train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = cifar10.load_data()

# Normalize pixel values to be between 0 and 1
train_images, test_images = train_images / 255.0, test_images / 255.0

# One-hot encode the labels
train_labels = to_categorical(train_labels, 10)
test_labels = to_categorical(test_labels, 10)

#Step 3: Build the CNN Model

model = models.Sequential()

# Convolutional layers
model.add(layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 3)))
model.add(layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))
model.add(layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'))
model.add(layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))
model.add(layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'))

# Dense layers
model.add(layers.Flatten())
model.add(layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'))
model.add(layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax'))

model.summary()
#Step 4: Compile the Model

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])
#Step 5: Train the Model

model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=10, validation_data=(test_images, test_labels))
#Step 6: Evaluate the Model
test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(test_images, test_labels)
print(f'Test accuracy: {test_acc}')

#Step 7: Model Optimization
#You can explore various techniques for model optimization:
#Data Augmentation: Augment the training dataset by applying random transformations to the images (rotation, flip, zoom, etc.).
#Dropout: Add dropout layers to reduce overfitting.
#Learning Rate Schedulers: Adjust the learning rate during training.
#Batch Normalization: Normalize the inputs of each layer to reduce internal covariate shift.

#Step 8: Save and Load the Model
# Save the model
model.save('cifar10_model.h5')

# Load the model
loaded_model = models.load_model('cifar10_model.h5')
#This is a basic example to get you started. Depending on your specific use case and dataset, you may need to fine-tune the architecture and hyperparameters. Experiment with different configurations to improve the performance of your model.
